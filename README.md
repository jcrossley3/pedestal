# Pedestal [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/pedestal.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/pedestal)

Pedestal is a set of libraries written in Clojure that aims to bring
both the language and its principles (Simplicity, Power and Focus) to
server-side development.

## Getting started

### Starting a new project

Use [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) (2.2.0+) to create a new
Pedestal service. This will automatically pull templates from
<http://clojars.org>

```bash
# To create a new service:
lein new pedestal-service the-next-big-server-side-thing
```

See [documentation](#documentation) for information on Pedestal concepts and
advice on getting started.

## Digging deeper

### Roadmap

Our primary focus for the near future is Pedestal documentation, sample
applications and improving general ease of use.

### Documentation

 * [Pedestal documentation](./guides) is coupled within this repository.
 * API Docs: generate literate-programming-style API docs by following the
  instructions within the [guides](./guides/documentation/index.md#what-about-api-documentation).

### Supported Platforms

At present Pedestal supports OSX and Linux environments. At this time we do not
support using Pedestal on a Windows environment.

**Some good news**: We will still gladly accept pull requests extending our
Windows support

**The bad news**: We will not invest significant amounts of time into
diagnosing or correcting Windows issues.
